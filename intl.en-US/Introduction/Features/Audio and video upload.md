## Short video SDK

You can use the short video SDK to record, import, and edit short videos. When you record short videos by using the SDK, you can choose from multiple resolutions, apply beautification and filter effects in real time, switch between cameras, and set the flash mode. You can also add face stickers during recording by using the facial recognition SDK. The short video SDK supports advanced editing features. You can crop short videos by frame size or duration, merge multiple videos, and add rich effects such as filters, animated stickers, music, music videos \(MVs\), subtitles, and doodles. You can customize your user interface \(UI\) based on the product-level open source UI that comes with the short video SDK. The short video SDK also provides easy-to-use, stable, and unified operations for recording, importing, cropping, and editing short videos. This way, you can implement customized secondary development.
