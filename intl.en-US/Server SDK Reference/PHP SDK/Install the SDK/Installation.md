# Installation

This topic describes the prerequisites for installing ApsaraVideo VOD SDK for PHP. It also describes how to install, update, and uninstall the SDK.

## Prerequisites

PHP 5.3 or later is used. You can run the `php -v` command to query the current PHP version. For more information about how to install PHP, visit the [PHP official website](https://www.php.net/downloads.php?spm=a2c4g.11186623.2.15.4f893a65t7oDDC).

## Install the SDK

1.  Create a folder **aliyun-php-sdk** in your PHP project to centrally manage SDK files.
2.  Download the source code at [aliyun-openapi-php-sdk](https://github.com/aliyun/aliyun-openapi-php-sdk?spm=a2c4g.11186623.2.16.4f893a65rF7WEF). Decompress the downloaded package and copy the **aliyun-php-sdk-core** and **aliyun-php-sdk-vod** folders to the **aliyun-php-sdk** directory.

**Note:** We recommend that you use **aliyun-php-sdk-core** 1.3.8 or later and **aliyun-php-sdk-vod** 2.15.1 or later.

## Update the SDK

If new operations or new features of existing operations are unavailable in the current SDK version, upgrade the SDK to the latest version. Download the source code at [aliyun-openapi-php-sdk](https://github.com/aliyun/aliyun-openapi-php-sdk?spm=a2c4g.11186623.2.17.4f893a65NYnSbw). Decompress the downloaded package and copy the **aliyun-php-sdk-core** and **aliyun-php-sdk-vod** folders to the **aliyun-php-sdk** directory. You can query the SDK version by using one of the following methods:

1.  Open the **ChangeLog.txt** file in the **aliyun-php-sdk-core** or **aliyun-php-sdk-vod** folder. The first line of the file indicates the SDK version.
2.  View the latest SDK version on the [download page](https://github.com/aliyun/aliyun-openapi-php-sdk?spm=a2c4g.11186623.2.18.4f893a65PxqYa0).
