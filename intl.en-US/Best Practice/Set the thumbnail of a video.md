# Set the thumbnail of a video

To beautify the display of videos, ApsaraVideo VOD sets a thumbnail for each uploaded video and provides multiple ways for you to change the thumbnail. After a video is uploaded, ApsaraVideo VOD takes snapshots. If you specify a snapshot as the thumbnail during the upload, the specified snapshot is set as the thumbnail by default. Otherwise, one of the snapshots is used as the default thumbnail. You can change the thumbnail after the video is uploaded.

## Set the thumbnail by using the API or SDK

ApsaraVideo VOD provides various [methods to upload videos](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Upload Medias/Overview.md). You can specify the thumbnail when you upload a video. If you do not specify a thumbnail, ApsaraVideo VOD selects a snapshot as the default thumbnail. You can call the following operations to set the thumbnail:

-   When you call the [CreateUploadVideo](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Media upload/CreateUploadVideo.md) operation, you can set the CoverURL parameter to specify the URL of the thumbnail.
-   When you call the [UploadMediaByURL](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Media upload/UploadMediaByURL.md) operation, you can set the CoverURL parameter in UploadMetadata to specify the URL of the thumbnail.
-   If the video is stored in Object Storage Service \(OSS\), you can call the [RegisterMedia](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Media upload/RegisterMedia.md) operation to register the media asset in ApsaraVideo VOD. When you call this operation, you can set the CoverURL parameter in RegisterMetadata to specify the URL of the thumbnail.
-   After the video is uploaded to ApsaraVideo VOD, you can call the [UpdateVideoInfo](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Media asset management/Audio and video management/UpdateVideoInfo.md) or [UpdateVideoInfos](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Media asset management/Audio and video management/UpdateVideoInfos.md) operation and set the CoverURL parameter to specify the URL of the thumbnail.

## Use the intelligent thumbnail feature

The intelligent thumbnail feature can analyze video content and extract multiple snapshots that best represent the video content as backup thumbnails. This feature can also extract keyframes from the video content and automatically merge them into a GIF file as the video thumbnail. To experience the intelligent thumbnail feature, click [here](https://retina.aliyun.com). Before you use the [intelligent thumbnail](https://ai.aliyun.com/vi/cover) feature, submit an application to enable the feature.
