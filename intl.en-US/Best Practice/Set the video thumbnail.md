# Set the video thumbnail

To beautify the display of videos, ApsaraVideo VOD allows you to add a thumbnail to each uploaded video and provides multiple ways for you to change the thumbnail. After a video is uploaded, ApsaraVideo VOD takes snapshots. If you specify a snapshot as the thumbnail during the upload, the specified snapshot is set as the thumbnail by default. Otherwise, one of the snapshots is used as the default thumbnail. You can change the thumbnail after the video is uploaded.
