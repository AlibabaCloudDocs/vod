## Upload settings

-   Storage address settings

    Select an address to store the resources that you upload. If multiple storage addresses are available, the default storage address is selected. For more information about how to configure the default storage address, see [Manage VOD resources](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Global settings/Manage VOD resources.md).

-   Transcoding settings
    -   Before you upload videos, you can select a transcoding template group to transcode the videos as needed. You can specify a transcoding template group for one or more videos at a time.
    -   You can configure different definitions in the transcoding template group. You can also customize resolutions, bitrates, and watermarks for the videos of different definitions. For more information, see [Manage transcoding settings](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Global settings/Manage transcoding settings.md).
    -   After you upload videos, the default template group that you configure is selected for the videos. If you upload videos for the first time, check and manage the transcoding settings so that the uploaded videos are transcoded based on your settings.
-   Category settings

    Before you upload media files, you can modify the title and category of the media files. You can modify the category of one or more media files at a time. You can also modify the category of media files on the details page of the files after they are uploaded. For more information about how to configure categories, see [Manage video categories](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Global settings/Manage video categories.md).

## Upload files on the PC client

We recommend that you use the PC client to upload large files or upload multiple files at a time. The uploaded files are displayed in the console. The ApsaraVideo VOD console supports media upload, media asset management, and short video and animated sticker editing. More features will be available soon. Log on to the ApsaraVideo VOD console as a RAM user on the client. This helps you isolate permissions and reduce the risk of configuration errors in the console. For more information about RAM users and AccessKey management, see [Create and grant permissions to a RAM user](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Access authorization/Create and grant permissions to a RAM user.md).

Download the PC client of an appropriate application version.
