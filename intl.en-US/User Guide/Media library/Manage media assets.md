# Manage media assets

The ApsaraVideo VOD console allows you to upload multiple media assets such as audio, videos, images, and short video materials at a time. This topic uses videos as an example to describe how to manage media assets.

## Manage videos

1.  Log on to the [ApsaraVideo VOD console](https://vod.console.aliyun.com/).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane of the ApsaraVideo VOD console, choose **Media Files** \> **Audio/Video**.

    You can filter videos by the type, category, status, and source. You can also enter the ID or name of a video to search for the video.

    The value in the Status column indicates the processing status of the video, including Uploading, Uploaded, Transcoding, Transcoding Failed, Normal, Reviewing, Flagged, and All.

    **Note:** If your video is in the Transcoding Failed state, delete the video and upload it again. If the transcoding fails for multiple times, submit a [ticket](https://selfservice.console.aliyun.com/ticket/createIndex).
