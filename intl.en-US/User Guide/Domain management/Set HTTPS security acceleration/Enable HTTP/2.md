# Enable HTTP/2

HTTP/2 is the latest version of HTTP. HTTP/2 enables more efficient access to resources. This topic describes the concept and benefits of HTTP/2. This topic also describes how to enable HTTP/2.

HTTP/2 is also called HTTP 2.0. Compared with HTTP 1.1, HTTP/2 provides new features such as multiplexing, header compression, request priority setting, and server push. HTTP/2 resolves the issues in HTTP 1.1, optimizes the request performance, and is compatible with the semantics of HTTP/1.1. HTTP/2 is supported by browsers such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer 11, Safari, and Mozilla Firefox.

HTTP/2 has the following benefits:

-   Binary encoding: Unlike HTTP 1.x that parses data into texts, HTTP/2 splits the data to be transmitted into messages and frames and encodes them into binary formats. Binary encoding makes HTTP/2 more scalable. For example, frames can be introduced to transmit data and instructions.
-   Content security: HTTP/2 is designed based on HTTPS and ensures content security. You can use HTTP/2 to minimize performance degradation that is caused by using only HTTPS.
-   Multiplexing: HTTP/2 allows multiplexing of multiple concurrent streams on a single connection. Specifically, you can initiate countless requests at the same time over one connection by using a browser. The server responds to these requests at the same time. In addition, you can set stream dependencies, which the client uses to inform the server of the importance of a given stream relative to other streams on the same connection. This ensures that resources are appropriately allocated.
-   Header compression: HTTP headers carry large volumes of information, which is repeatedly transmitted. HTTP/2 compresses HTTP headers into the HPACK format. Both ends of the communications cache a copy of the HTTP header indexes and hence transmit only index numbers for duplicate HTTP headers. This increases transmission speed and efficiency.

## Prerequisites

An HTTPS certificate is configured before you enable **HTTP/2**. For more information, see [Enable HTTPS secure acceleration](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Domain management/Set HTTPS security acceleration/Enable HTTPS secure acceleration.md).

**Note:**

-   If you are configuring an HTTPS certificate for the first time, you must wait for the certificate to take effect before you enable HTTP/2.
-   If you disable HTTPS certificates after you enable HTTP/2, HTTP/2 is automatically disabled.
