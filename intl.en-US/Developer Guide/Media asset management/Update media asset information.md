**Call methods:** 

* We recommend that you use a server SDK to obtain media asset information by calling the API operations. This method is simpler and more efficient. For more information about server SDKs, see [Usage notes](/intl.en-US/Server SDK Reference/Instructions.md). For more information about API operations, see the "`SDK example`" section of API references.

  

* For more information about how to generate HTTP or HTTPS requests, see [Common parameters](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Calling methods/Common parameters.md) and [Examples](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Calling methods/Call Examples.md).
