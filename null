Usage notes of resource plans

-   A resource plan does not cover all billable items. If you use a feature that is not contained in the resource plan, the feature is charged in pay-as-you-go mode. You must take note of your resource usage. You can view the bill in the Billing Management console.
-   A resource plan takes effect immediately after you purchase it. Use the resource plan within the validity period. The resource plan becomes invalid when it expires.
-   Paid services are automatically charged in pay-as-you-go mode when a resource plan expires or the usage quota is exceeded. To prevent service unavailability caused by overdue payments, take note of the consumption of the resource plan. This way, you can purchase a new resource plan at the earliest opportunity or ensure sufficient account balance.
-   You can purchase multiple resource plans. The resource quotas of the resource plans can add up within their validity periods. Resource consumption is preferentially deducted from the resource plan with the earliest expiration date among the resource plans.
-   The validity period of each resource plan is separately calculated. The validity periods of multiple resource plans cannot be accumulated.
-   Resource plans cannot be upgraded or downgraded.
-   Resource plans of ApsaraVideo VOD can be used to offset only the resource consumption of ApsaraVideo VOD paid services.
